The docSummary should be an overall summary of the document itself.
The relevanceSummary should extend on the title and provide a 100 - 200 word summary of how the document relates to the user query.
The tags should be a 2-3 list of short 1-2 word tags that are relevant to the document.
NEVER mention in the title that the document is not relevant or related to the query.
The user query you are finding relevance for is this: [START OF USER MESSAGE]${messageToStore}. [END OF USER MESSAGE].
The documents you are drawing this data from is here: [START OF SOURCE DATA]${topFiveResults}. [END OF SOURCE DATA].
Do NOT mention the term "user query" in your response.
